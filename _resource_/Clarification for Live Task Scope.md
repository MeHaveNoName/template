# Clarification for Live Task Scope

## Scope of the Live Task

The live task is focused on creating a basic user interface using Next.js/React and involves the following:

1. **Card Component Development**:
   - Use the data fetched from the provided API endpoint (`src/pages/api/dummy.ts`) to build a `Card` component.
   - The `Card` component design should closely match the reference images located in the `_resource_` folder.

2. **LoadButton Component**:
   - Create a `LoadButton` component.
   - It should dynamically load and display four additional cards each time it is clicked, starting with an initial display of four cards.

3. **Styling**:
   - Use `SASS` or `styled-components` (both are pre-installed) to style the components. `styled-components` is preferred but not mandatory.

## Topics Covered

The task will test skills in:
- React component development.
- Data fetching and handling asynchronous operations.
- Modular and clean code structure.
- Responsive and accessible UI design.
- Styling with `SASS` or `styled-components`.
- Best practices.

## Tools Used for Coding

- **Development Platform**: You may use VSCode or any editor of your choice.
- **Git**: Required for cloning the task template and version control.

## Required Technologies

1. **React**: For building UI components.
2. **JavaScript**: For implementing the core logic.
3. **API Integration**:
   - Utilize the provided API endpoint (`src/pages/api/dummy.ts`) to fetch card data.
4. **Styling**:
   - Use either `SASS` or `styled-components` for component styling. (Preference for `styled-components` is a plus.)
5. **Testing**:
   - Write tests using `Jest` and `react-testing-library` to ensure component reliability and functionality.

### Additional Notes

- The task requires adhering to best practices for code readability, modularity, and responsiveness.
- The `_resource_` folder provides all necessary design references and data samples for testing.
